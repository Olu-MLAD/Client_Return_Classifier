### PROJECT TITLE: IFSSA Client Return Prediction

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to predict which clients of the Islamic Family and Social Services Association (IFSSA) will return for services within 3 months using machine learning.

### Problem Statement

The IFSSA (Islamic Family and Social Services Association) struggles to predict when and how many clients will return to get hampers, leading to challenges in inventory management, resource allocation, and client retention strategies. This uncertainty affects operational efficiency and limits the ability to tailor the organizationâ€™s efforts effectively.

### Solution

We developed a Random Forest classifier that:
- Processes 6 key client visit features
- Provides binary predictions (1=return, 0=won't return)
- Includes explainable AI insights

### Live Application
